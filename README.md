# WP Project

## Details of new features


To manage the session, a library called bullmq was used, with this we can decouple part of the project so that it does not restart when another project suffers any HTTP connection, so the sessions are saved in cache

## Installation

Version Node.JS [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) v10+ to run.

Install the dependencies and devDependencies and start the server.

```sh
npm install 
or
yarn
```

## About services

Now, to use the application, it will be necessary to initialize two services, one is the HTTP service to receive connections via Rest, and another service that takes care of all whatsapp processes

```sh
yarn http 
or
npm run http

and 

yarn wts
or 
yarn run wts
```

If you are going to use this application on a linux server it will be necessary to install some dependencies, below you will find the instruction to install them on your server

```sh
sudo apt-get install -y libxshmfence-dev libgbm-dev wget unzip fontconfig locales gconf-service libasound2 libatk1.0-0 libc6 libcairo2 libcups2 libdbus-1-3 libexpat1 libfontconfig1 libgcc1 libgconf-2-4 libgdk-pixbuf2.0-0 libglib2.0-0 libgtk-3-0 libnspr4 libpango-1.0-0 libpangocairo-1.0-0 libstdc++6 libx11-6 libx11-xcb1 libxcb1 libxcomposite1 libxcursor1 libxdamage1 libxext6 libxfixes3 libxi6 libxrandr2 libxrender1 libxss1 libxtst6 ca-certificates fonts-liberation libappindicator1 libnss3 lsb-release xdg-utils
